Q. Explain JDK, JRE and JVM.
ANSWER. JDK is a full software development kit used for developing Java applications.
JRE is a package that contains everything needed to run Java programs but not to develop them.
JVM is an abstract machine that runs Java bytecode, making Java platform-independent (Write Once, Run Anywhere).

Q. Why Java is platform independent?
ANSWER. Java is platform-independent because Java programs can run on any operating system without modification.
This is achieved through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which acts as an intermediary between Java programs 
and the underlying hardware.

Q. Why java is not 100% Object-Oriented?
ANSWER. Java is not considered 100% object-oriented because it includes primitive data types (int, char, boolean, etc.), 
which are not objects.
In a fully object-oriented language, everything should be an object, but Java allows primitive types for performance reasons.

Q. List the five features of Java?
ANSWER. 1. Platform Independence (Write Once, Run Anywhere - WORA)
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
3. Robust and Secure
4. Multithreading (Concurrency Support)
5. High Performance with Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler

Q. Which component is used to compile, debug and execute java program?
ANSWER. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is the component used to compile, debug, and 
execute Java programs. It includes all the necessary tools for Java development.

Q. Which component is responsible to run java program?
ANSWER. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the component responsible for running Java programs.

Q. What is use of interpreter?
ANSWER. An interpreter is a program that translates and executes code line by line rather than compiling the entire 
program at once.
In Java, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) uses an interpreter to convert bytecode into machine-specific code for execution.
